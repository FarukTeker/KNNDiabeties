# KNNDiabeties

This project applies k-Nearest Neighbors to the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

Run `python3 KNN-Diabetes/diyabetes.py` after installing the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
The script performs a grid search over various KNN options including distance metrics and algorithms, then reports the best crossâ€‘validation accuracy and the test results.
